# [`artofmo`](https://github.com/maxhudson/artofmo) examples

### Instructions for trying examples

You don't need to use the command line/terminal to do this.

These instructions are not yet verified on Windows, but should work.

They're also not super thorough, but should be enough. Please report any important missing pieces.

1. Download this repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/maxhudson/artofmo-examples/archive/master.zip)
1. Extract the downloaded zip file
1. Use Google Chrome and install this extension if you don't already have it: ([Webserver for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en))
1. Open the extension
  1. Choose the folder `artofmo-examples-master` that you extracted from the zip
  1. Make sure you have the switch below choose folder turned on (it'll be blue when on).
  1. Copy the link from the extension window under `Web Server URL(s)` and paste it in your browser
    1. It should look like this, but maybe with different numbers: `http://127.0.0.1:8887`
1. Add `/examples-by-version/v0-0-5/main.html?work=2018-09-29-plant-spirals` to the end of that url and hit enter
1. If this doesn't work, read the instructions once more and try again. Let me know on instagram @artofmo if that doesn't work.

##### You can change the version by changing these numbers:

`examples-by-version/v`0-0-5`/main.html?work=2018-09-29-plant-spirals`

##### You can change the work (the specific piece of art) by changing this:

`examples-by-version/v0-0-5/main.html?work=`2018-09-29-plant-spirals

##### You can find which versions and works are available by browsing the exracted zip files.
